## What we do
*[place mission statement here]*

## Our Story
It all started when we, President JB Santos and Vice President Mariano Buitrago, got the inspiration of the idea to create a Students for Life club from the President of the Riverside HS Students for Life Club, Kieran Sweeney in the school year of 2021-22. Our mission is to advocate for all life. The only difference between some other Pro-life clubs/organizations across the country? We advocate for all lives; not just for those who are unborn or young.
